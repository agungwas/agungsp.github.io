Together with Dan, they set out to defeat Naga and Masquerade, and bring back the Infinity and Silent Core to Vestroia. He has the ability to radiate intense heat in battle dissolving everything around him. He is equipped with high intelligence. He is limited in battle mobility but compensates for it through powerful strikes. He is able to infinitely evolve on his own and with every evolution, it makes him stronger and it brings him one step closer to the Infinity Core</p>
